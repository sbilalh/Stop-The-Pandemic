This program takes in a file containing pairs of connected integers on each line. It generates an unweighted, undirected graph (represented as an adjacency list using <ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>> and removes a specified number nodes based on either the degree or the collective influence of each node (radius must be given to calculate collective influence).
