# Stop the Pandemic!

This program is designed to mimic social networks in the form of graphs and isolate certain nodes. 

It takes in a file containing pairs of connected integers on each line, generating an unweighted, undirected graph (represented as an adjacency list) and removes a specified number nodes based on either the nodes with the highest degree or the collective influence of each node based on a specified radius (depth of a node) using a variants of BFS and DFS. The program will also output the connected components of the graph (excluding the nodes that are isolated) after the removal of each node.
